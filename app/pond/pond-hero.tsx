/**
 * The swan pond, as a hero.
 *
 * `startPond` (lifted from the standalone artifact) owns everything inside the
 * frame: the painted pond floor, weeds, overhanging vines and blossom, drifting
 * leaves, three painted swans, the ripple and wake simulation, and the water and
 * brushwork shaders. It pauses while off-screen or in a hidden tab, and steps
 * its own render resolution down if frames start taking too long.
 *
 * This component only gives it a frame to live in and keeps its look in step
 * with the clock: dawn, day, dusk, dark.
 *
 * The canvases are created inside the effect so that React strict mode's double
 * mount gets fresh WebGL contexts rather than a lost one.
